# SPA-Router-Vanilla-JS

<img src="/public/img/spahomepage.png">

This is a simple demo for a single-page application built in vanilla JS. Using a JS framework to build a small
application is a little-bit overkill sometimes, but you may still want the benefits of having a single-page app.
This is a good solution to that problem.

Clone this repo to your machine and start it up in a live server.

VSCode has a good extension for this. Then visit the site at localhost on the port your server is running on.
